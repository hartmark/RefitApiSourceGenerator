# RefitApiSourceGenerator

The idea is to use source generators to create an minimal API with just using the refit interface.

In the project ``Api`` there's an interface ``IRandomApiSpecification`` and that will be used as template to create the minimal API.

This is just a simple PoC I have hacked toghether and I don't know if and/or when I will do any more work on it.

I just wanted to share this code if someone was interested in doing something similar.

PRs are welcome :)
